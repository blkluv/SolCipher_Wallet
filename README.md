## ğŸ“– Introduction

Crowdfunding platforms are essential for raising funds, but traditional systems often lack transparency and involve high fees. Our **Crowdfunding Using Blockchain** project leverages the decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature of blockchain to provide a secure and cost-efficient crowdfunding experience.

Built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Solidity**, **Hardhat**, and **Thirdweb**, this dApp allows users to create and fund campaigns on the Ethereum blockchain (Arbitrum testnet) and includes an **Admin Panel** to moderate campaigns.
